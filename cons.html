    </p>
    <h2 >Decline in craftsmanship and artistry </h2><!--subheading-->
    <p>Traditional watches are known to be luxury timepieces and have been celebrating this for their intricate craftsmanship and artistry. Watchmakers have been spending years to make a watch using their skills to create precise, handcrafted movements that are considered a work of art but nowadays as  a result of technology people have loosen interest around these watches and are more focused on the smartwatches which rely on mass-produced electronic components which prioritize functionality over craftsmanship. As a result the demand for traditional craftsmanship has faced a huge decline and is now on the verge of being diminished.
    </p>
    <h2 >Loss of emotional connection </h2><!--subheading-->
    <p>Traditional watches are known to carry sentimental values over generations and are passed on to the newer ones. They carry a story of one’s family, milestones, achievements, and personal stories. But newer generations of watches  known as smartwatches rely on the chipsets and the electronics making them outdated in just a couple of months as a result consumers tend to upgrade their watches which has created the loss of emotional connection of watches to the owner.</p>
    <h2 > Threat to independent watchmakers </h2><!--subheading-->
    <p>As newer generations of watches revolve around tech giants like Apple,Samsung and oppo independent watchmakers(Traditional watchmakers) and smaller brands have an unfair competition in the market as they have huge resources to dominate advertising and disturbing channels. This has caused a decline in diversity of the watch industry which has made traditional watchmakers work to be unnoticed causing their work to be unnoticed.</p>
    <h2 > Cultural shift in timekeeping</h2><!--subheading-->
    <p>Traditional watches are not just mere timepieces, they have a huge cultural history, signifying traditional and personal style.  However, due to the rise of smartwatches this has shifted the cultural narrative as well as consumers don’t care about the personal style and are known to wear the watches which keeps up with the trend. As a trend consumers tend to throw away their watches  as soon as the trend is over resulting in huge pollution.</p>
    <p>While technology has undoubtedly brought many benefits to the watch industry it has also caused a significant amount of challenges to traditional watchmakers, bringing more waste to society . As we progress more to  a digital age it is necessary to preserve old watches as well as recognize and preserve these artistry and heritage. After all a watch is more than just a device it contains people's emotions as well as their family history, their milestones. We the society needs to create a balance between new innovations and honoring tradition, the watch industry can continue to thrive in a world increasingly shaped by technology.</p>
