    <h2>Change in Consumer Preference</h2><!--subheading-->
    <p>Technology has revolutionized the consumer preference for convenience and functionality. The newer generations are attracted to smartwatches that offer features such as fitness tracking, connectivity, and fashionable looks rather than the craftsmanship and heritage offered by conventional watches</p>
    <h2>Sales Trends:</h2>
	<p>Younger Audiences: Gen Z individuals and Millennials are intrigued more with smartwatches since these are integrated into online lifestyles.

	<h2> Opportunities for Innovation</h2>
	<p>Despite the challenges, technology has also created opportunities for the watch industry:

		Hybrid Watches: They combine traditional design with smart integrations, making them appeal to both traditionalists and technologically savvy individuals.

While smartwatches have taken a lion's share of the market, traditional watches still have their value as timeless pieces of craftsmanship and heritage. As the industry continues to evolve, finding a balance between innovation and tradition will be crucial for sustaining growth. By embracing technology to augment their products while preserving their unique artistry, watchmakers can thrive in this rapidly changing landscape.
